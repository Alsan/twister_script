twister_install
===============

Twister Installer script for Linux hosts. [Twister](https://github.com/miguelfreitas/twister-core) is the fully decentralized P2P microblogging platform leveraging from the free software implementations of Bitcoin and BitTorrent protocols. 

Creates a hidden dir in ~/ for storage of files and executable.

At present this script only functions on Debian based machines. Will endeavour to extend that.
