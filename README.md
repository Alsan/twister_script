Twister Install Script
======================

Twister Installer script for Linux hosts. [Twister](https://github.com/miguelfreitas/twister-core) is the fully decentralized P2P microblogging platform leveraging from the free software implementations of Bitcoin and BitTorrent protocols. 

Creates a hidden dir in ~/ for storage of files and executable.

At present this script only functions on the Debian based operating systems, so for example:

* Debian
* Ubuntu
* Linux Mint
