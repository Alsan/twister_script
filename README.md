===============

Twister Installer script for Linux hosts. [Twister](https://github.com/miguelfreitas/twister-core) is the fully decentralized P2P microblogging platform leveraging from the free software implementations of Bitcoin and BitTorrent protocols. 

Creates a hidden dir in ~/ for storage of files and executable.

At present this script only functions on the Debian based operating systems, so for example:

-Debian
-Ubuntu
-Linux Mint

I am hoping to add more operating systems. Next on the cards will be Arch and Fedora.
